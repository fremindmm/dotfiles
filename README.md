## About

This is my own dotfile configuration files for both Linux and Mac OS

## Install

VIM Initialization:

    git clone git://github.com/xiaoquqi/dotfiles.git
    cd dotfiles
    ./install.sh

Before you run vim, you also need to install an extra package called ctags, in ubuntu 12.04, you can run:

    sudo apt-get install exuberant-ctags

Otherwise, you need to build from source http://ctags.sf.net
